# Financial-Sentiment-Analysis
My Masters Project (Empowering Market Forecasting and Investment Decisions with Advanced Sentiment Analysis Techniques.)

Financial sentiment analysis, a critical aspect of financial technology, interprets and classifies the sentiments of financial data. This project aims to develop machine learning models using a combined dataset to predict financial sentiments. The data used for the implementation of the models is derived from three distinct datasets; FiQA, Financial PhraseBank and SentFIN v1.1, and were sourced from Kaggle, a renowned platform for machine learning and data science competitions. It provides financial sentences with sentiment labels. Essential textual and sentiment features are extracted from these financial sentences. Each modelâ€™s performance is evaluated and compared to determine their effectiveness in detecting financial sentiments. This analysis can provide valuable insights into market trends and investor behavior, thereby aiding in informed decision-making.
